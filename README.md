Random Walk Price Simulator 📈🎲
A lightweight Python project that simulates a random walk on returns and converts it into a synthetic price path using geometric compounding. This repository provides a simple, intuitive way to explore how randomness in returns evolves into market‑like price behavior.

The project includes:

i.i.d. return generation

return → price mapping

price path visualization

return distribution plots (histogram + KDE)

clean, modular code structure

Perfect as a compact introduction to stochastic processes in finance.

Features
Generate random returns using a simple Gaussian model

Convert returns into prices via exponential compounding

Plot price paths to visualize the evolution

Plot return distributions to inspect randomness

Minimal, readable codebase
